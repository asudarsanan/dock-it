# Documentation

This directory contains extended documentation for dock-it beyond the main README.

## Contents

- [Architecture](architecture.md) – deep dive into the cmd/internal layout, data flow, and UI/Docker boundaries
- [Notes](notes.md) – scratchpad for troubleshooting steps, release planning, or meeting notes

## Contributing to Docs

1. Keep documents in Markdown.
2. Prefer short, task-focused files over one giant document.
3. Link new documents from this index so they are discoverable.

When updating workflows or architecture, please include a brief summary here and in the main README if user-facing.
